I am presently a Graduate Student in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. My work mostly involves Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Visualization, Probability Theory and Heuristics. 

A bachelor's in Chemical Engineering, my exposure to Statistics began while working at one of India's largest petroleum refineries. My team focused on process improvement; experiments were designed to quantify cause-effect and functionality was sequentially added and A/B tested before deploying to production.

Upon graduating, I joined the Process Mechanics team I had previously interned for at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. We were working on modeling the distribution of water molecules in a petroleum desalter. We worked cross-functionally with client-side production teams. While collaborating with the Cell Mechanics lab, I was also responsible for automating the tracking the movement of cellular particles using Kalman Filtering. 

During my time working as a Data Science Intern at Tesla, CA, my job role involved serving as the system logic owner for the Tesla's Material Requirement Planning (MRP) and Transportation Management System (TMS). We were consistently called upon by operations teams for system support and trouble-shooting to aid high-impact planning/logistics operations.
We were also responsible to creating ML tools to improve truck utilization so as to minimize logistics costs. The tools created a significant impact to organization-wide truck utilization as well as directed business decision to undertake similar projects within the team.
